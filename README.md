    Link Prediction for Social Network

</p>
  
## About The Repository
This Project deals with link/edge prediction in Social Networks. A network is represented as an undirected Graph. Given a Grpah/Social nework, We have to predict edges/connections which may come into exsitence from non-existent edges of Graph.For predicton, we use various score based method, which assigns score to each non-existent edge of graph. Based on this score we can predict edges which may come into existence in future.

We will use score based functions to assign score to all non-existent edges:
1. Kat'z Score
2. Jaccard's coefficient
3. Hitting Time
4. rooted PageRank
